I'm pleased to announce today that I'm rolling out a new version of my personal brand, visual identity, and website. This is the culmination of a lot of work by my internal marketing function, and it's absolutely something to celebrate.

## New headshot

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3">
  <div class="border">
    <img src="/img/old-zeke-headshot.jpg" style="margin:0" />
    <div class="p-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Old headshot from 2019</div>
  </div>
  <div class="border">
    <img src="/img/zeke.jpeg" style="margin:0" />
    <div class="p-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Today's new headshot from the inspired <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_be_nice_comic/">Be Nice Comic</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

## New logo and name

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3">
  <div class="border flex flex-col">
    <div class="h-32 bg-gray-400 bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-200 to-gray-50 flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0" style="margin:0">
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-6 w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor">
        <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M9.172 16.172a4 4 0 015.656 0M9 10h.01M15 10h.01M21 12a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z"></path>
      </svg>
    </div>
    <div class="p-2 text-sm text-gray-600">There was no logo or brand name</div>
  </div>
  <div class="border">
    <div  class="h-32 bg-gray-400 bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-200 to-gray-50 flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0" style="margin:0">
      <div
        style="transform: scale(0.9)"
        class="
          shadow-2xl
          bg-gray-800
          ring-4 ring-offset-transparent ring-offset-2 ring-gray-800
          overflow-hidden
          flex flex-row
        "
      >
        <div class="flex flex-col w-12">
          <div class="flex-grow"></div>
          <div class="bg-gradient-to-bl h-2.5 bg-white"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="text-white whitespace-nowrap flex-grow text-5xl font-mono font-semibold p-4 pl-0">
          off-by-one
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="p-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Brand new name and logo</div>
  </div>
</div>

Inspired by one of the most common programing errors, off-by-one evokes the sense that I'm just a little bit out there... that a couple screws might be a little loose--a reality that I'm embracing today.

My internal design function burnt the midnight oil considering many alternate logos before finally landing on one that captured my ethos.

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img class="sm:w-2/3" src="/img/alt-logos.png"/>
</div>

## Why I refreshed my brand identity

My prior identity was established in early 2019. Today, we live in a different world. In 2019, I was attempting to appear professional, considered, and deliberate. But, the feedback from the community was that the brand was a touch boring. We heard you. With today's refresh, you'll find a more jovial, playful, and creative Zeke.

## Engineering

My internal engineering function has worked hard to deliver this site. It's build with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Most of my pre-existing content has already been ported.

## Content

You can expect to read articles, luke-warm takes, talks and shitposts. The Content Function is still rerecording some older talks and articles. Stay on the lookout for those. They will be backdated to their original release dates.
