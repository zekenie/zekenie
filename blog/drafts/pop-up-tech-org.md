Running a pop-up tech org is wildly different than running tech in any other context. It's like moving to a parallel universe where all the constants are different, and black holes push objects away. To make matters worse, you don't notice right away that things are different. You reach for familiar tools only to find that they don't work quite how they're supposed to.

**What is a pop-up tech org?** It's an organization (not neccicerally a legal entity) that didn't exist yesterday and does exist today--it likely won't exist for very long.

The organization I most recentlly participated in was [#walkthevote](https://wewalkthevote.com). In 2020, we built a tool to organize walking parties to the polls. You could walk your mail-in ballot to a drop-off box with your friends and other voters. Behind the scenes we did some data gathering, email campaigns, and integrated with [Mobilize](https://www.mobilize.us/).

Traditional organizations pay people for labor. There's a power structure that everyone understands. The organization has a pool of people with established knowledge, culture, and common reference points (oh yeah, we tried that a couple years ago and it didn't go as well as we thought...). People come and go, but at a rate slow enough to maintain a semblance of normalcy. If you're new, and you need to know something, you can ask someone. If they don't know the answer, chances are that they'll know who does.

Pop-up orgs are the opposite in almost every way. They're commonly run by volunteers. Power dynamics exist but are fluid and not always explicit. People come and go, almost like a neighborhood block party. Some contribute greatly, others just pop their head in and say "hi."

You _want_ people to join and be excited, so there's no interview process. You're just happy people are there. You end up with a really wide spectrum of volunteers. When someone joins, it's impossible to quickly assess their competencies, strengths, weaknesses, and capacity for work. If you're trying to steer the ship and also figure out which way is north, you have a lot of people with their hands in their pockets asking what they should be doing. You don't know who you can delegate to and who you can't. It's hard. It's very tempting to just do everything yourself.

Motivation without money is hard to predict, even for individuals

## advice

- prioritize synthesis and consistency of communication
- have a list of unsolved problems that are looking for owners
- greatly discount resume experience, take chances on people
- to determine who can't handle work, try exponential increase and backoff
- break people into groups to lower the complexity of the system. Instead of needing to manage 15 people, manage 5 groups.
- Determine work of last resort to keep people happy
